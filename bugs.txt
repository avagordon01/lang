bugfix break, continue instructions dont actually get compiled to assembly from IR
    what
    if you compile the IR manually with llc then assembler it works...
    either my invocation of passes is wrong
    or its a bug in llvm assembly output
    what
    llc, clang and everything else uses legacy
    no examples of using modern passmanager and cant find a way to emit machine code

    could narrow down the difference between my invocation and theirs
    or just invoke their command line
        could get nice CLI for free, and possibly optimisation etc
    would it stop us from compiling fine-grained modules for different targets? CPU/GPU?
switching from gcc to clang breaks the parsing
